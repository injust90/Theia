# Theia
A beginner rhythm game for Linux

# Overview
Theia is the digitization of the original game from the 80s SIMON. SIMON is a game where the player memorizes a sequence of buttons accompanied by unique notes. This will take it a step further by digitizing the previous work and discovering what made the original so fun. Along the way we will try to implement new innovations as fits within our scope and abilities.

# Goals for Theia
To continue on with SIMON’s legacy of an interactive children’s game where the player is utilizing their pattern memorization abilities. 

To reward the player with high score progression. The player should feel encouraged by their personal “high score” improving with each further movement of the pattern. (1-2-3-4 → 1-2-3-4-5). After a high score is achieved a song and screen will appear cheering the player on.

To encourage the player to replay and challenge themselves to progress further in their ability to memorize the random pattern provided.

Utilize the SDL2 library to make the inputs, draw the squares, and play the notes.

Learn how to make notes so the sounds are unique / exclusive to Theia. Nothing is taken online.
